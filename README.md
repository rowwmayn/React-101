# React 101 — Course README

## Course purpose
This course documents a practical path to learn modern React for building production-ready user interfaces and small-to-large scale web apps. Use this README as the central syllabus, history note, and a progress tracker for each video/lesson.

## 1. Brief history of React
- React was created by Jordan Walke at Facebook (first ideas around 2011) and open-sourced in 2013.
- It introduced the Virtual DOM and a component-based model that decoupled UI from imperative DOM manipulation.
- Major milestones:
  - JSX and component model (early releases)
  - React Fiber (rearchitect, ~2017) improved reconciliation and performance
  - Hooks (2019) simplified state and side-effect management in function components
  - Ongoing work: Concurrent features, Server Components, and improved SSR/hydration.

## 2. Why React is important
- Declarative UI: describe what the UI should be; React handles updates.
- Component-based: encourages reusable, testable units of UI.
- Performance patterns: Virtual DOM + selective reconciliation.
- Massive ecosystem: libraries for routing, state, testing, and native mobile (React Native).
- Strong community and industry adoption — many jobs and resources.

## 3. How to improve React (two angles)
- Improving your React skills:
  - Master hooks, component composition, and state management patterns.
  - Learn TypeScript with React for safer code.
  - Practice testing (React Testing Library, Jest) and performance profiling.
  - Build varied projects (SPAs, SSR, static sites, micro-frontends).
  - Prioritize accessibility (a11y) and progressive enhancement.
  - Read RFCs and follow core team discussions to understand direction.

- Contributing to React and the ecosystem:
  - Report/triage issues and write reproducible repros.
  - Contribute tests, docs, and small PRs to libraries or React itself.
  - Propose RFCs for ergonomic improvements (developer DX) and accessibility defaults.
  - Work on bundle-size savings (compile-time transforms, tree-shaking), SSR/hydration, or tooling (devtools, build integrations).
